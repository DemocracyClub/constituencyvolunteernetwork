Subject: Win a duck house. Seriously.
> Dear %(name)s,

OK, so you probably don't <b>need</b> a duck house. But who does?

No wait, don't answer that. But this is your bona fide chance to win one.

Here's the deal. We are missing the contact details for a whole load of candidates whom we want to survey about local issues and national issues.

We've made the process of gathering this information into a kind of game. For each bit of information you find, you'll win points. After the election, the volunteer who has the most points in this and any other games we come up with will win a genuine, full size duck house.

Click "start this task" to give it a go -- it's good fun!

P.S. Thanks for all the local issues many of you described for us last week. Please reply to this email if you have copy-writing skills you'd like to volunteer, so we can write questions for candidates based on these.
