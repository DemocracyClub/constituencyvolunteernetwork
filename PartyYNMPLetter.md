Dear X,

In the run up to the General Election there are several websites and iPhone applications being written.  Many of these are getting their candidate data from YourNextMP.com, a project affiliated with Democracy Club, which is getting lots of attention in the press at the moment.

We've seeded it with information grabbed from various sources including your website.Now it needs to be brought up to date.  We'll be asking our volunteers to work on it, but we wanted to give the parties themselves an opportunity to update the info first.

Could you ask your candidates and/or volunteers to visit http://www.yournextmp.com/parties/

&lt;party-code&gt;

 and check that all your candidates are listed? In a week or so, we'll be releasing figures to show which party has the most complete candidate listings, as a measure of grassroots support.

Alternatively, if you can provide us with a spreadsheet of candidate details (including contact details), we'll update the database automatically using that.
