If they do, read them to find if they make clear statements on local issues. If they don't have their own sites, check local newspaper sites or facebook to see if you can find anything. You could also check http://openlylocal.com/hyperlocal_sites for any nearby blogs. If you can't find any issues, why not drop some of your candidates a friendly email asking them to say what the most important changes they think need making in the constituency?\r\n<b>2.</b> You can ask questions and share experiences on the discussion forum here http://bit.ly/8tEumz\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>3.</b> You can hold Democracy Club Local Meetings in a pub or cafe of your choice.
