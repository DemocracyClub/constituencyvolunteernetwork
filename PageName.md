Subject: Your chance to meet other Democracy Club volunteers in $Constituency

Body:

Hello all,

I know how keen some of you are to meet up with other Democracy Club volunteers, and we're now ready to help you get together.



&lt;link&gt;



The plan is this: next Thursday volunteers all over the country are going to hold meetups all around the country, meetups where they'll talk about holding their candidates to account.

There are already events planned in half a dozen locations, but Democracy Club has members from John O'Groats to Lands End, so we're going to need a bunch more.

I can't stress how much this is up to you. There is no huge organisation behind DemocracyClub, or some rich funder. There's just us - we have to do this together. So please, if you want to be an attendee, be an organiser:
