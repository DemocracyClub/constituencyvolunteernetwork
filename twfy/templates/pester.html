<h3>Step 1. Send email reminders</h3>

<div class="span-4">
 {% if one_left %}
 <p>There's <strong>only one candidate left</strong> in your constituency who's not answered the survey!</p> 
{% endif %}
<p>Use the text box on the right to compose an email in your own words that will encourage the candidates to answer the questionnaire. <strong>Please read the tips below first.</strong></p>
<div style="font-size:0.9em;color:#336;">
    <p>Tips for writing an effective email:

    <ol> 
     <li>Think of an intriguing subject that will encourage them to open it: they're receiving hundreds of emails a day!  A question is good.</li>
     <li>Introduce yourself, <strong>making it clear you're in their constituency</strong> (<em>{{constituency.name}}</em>).</li>
     <li>Tell them you've been looking the TheyWorkForYou survey. Tell them why you think it's important. You might want to link to the BBC News story at <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/bUJZcI">http://bit.ly/bUJZcI</a>.</li>
     <li>Tell them that <strong>{{ total_count }}</strong> candidates have answered it already, and that in <em>{{constituency.name}}</em> 
        {% for c in filled_in %}
          {% if forloop.last %}{% ifnotequal 1 filled_in.count %} and {% endifnotequal %}{% endif %}the <strong>{{ c.candidate.party.name }}</strong> candidate{% if not forloop.last %}, {% else %}{% endif %}
          {% if forloop.last %}
            {% ifnotequal 1 filled_in.count %}have{% else %}has{% endifnotequal %} already filled it out.
          {% endif %}
        {% empty %}
          no-one has filled it out yet -- they can be the first!
        {% endfor %}
     </li>
 {% if one_tory_left %}
  <li>Unfortunately many Conservative candidates have been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/29/conservative-candidates-refuse-to-answer-questions">refusing to answer surveys</a>.  Please make a particular point that you're not happy to be fobbed off with standard boilerplate text about "nuances".</li>
 {% endif %}


     <li>Finish by telling them there's a link at the bottom of the email to the questionnaire, and say thankyou! (we automatically add the link to your email after you press 'send')</li>
     <li><strong>Sign off with your address</strong>, so they can see you're really from their constituency</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>Want to check what's in the survey? A <a target="_blank" href="http://election.theyworkforyou.com/survey/seats/{{constituency.twfy_slug}}">version of what they will see is here</a>, but <strong>don't email them this link</strong>: they can only answer the survey with a special link that we send them (and will add to the end of this email).</p>
