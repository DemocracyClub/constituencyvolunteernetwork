Subject: Help us monitor election leaflets

Hi %(name)s,
<br><br>
Thanks for registering as a volunteer with Democracy Club.  Now it's time for your first volunteer task!<br>
<br><br>
Please dig out of the bin any <b>election leaflets</b> you've recently received. Or ask friends or neighbours, or wait a few days until you get one through the door.<br>
<br><br>
Ready? To complete this task you first need to <b>photograph or scan</b> a leaflet (or several, if you want), transfer the image to your computer, and then click the 'start' link below to <b>upload the images</b>.<br>
<br><br>
%(buttons)s<br>
<br><br>
<h2>Why am I being asked to do this?</h2>

Leaflets normally get thrown away and the authorities do not have an official process for monitoring dodgy election leaflets, so it's <b>down to us</b> to make sure there is no funny business going on where we live!<br>
<br><br>
Democracy Club is doing this in partnership with our friends at <a href='http://www.TheStraightChoice.org/'>http://www.TheStraightChoice.org/</a>. They are creating a live online archive of election leaflets throughout the campaign. There are 2 reasons why this is a helpful thing to be doing:<br>
<br><br>
<b>1)</b> Promises that candidates make in their leaflets can be compared to what they promise to do elsewhere, for example in responses to the local issues you helped collect over the last few weeks. In the future we can also compare the voting record of MPs with what they promised on the campaign trail.<br>
<br><br>
<b>2)</b> It helps catch parties or candidates who are breaking electoral law - 2 parties have been reported to the authorities based on leaflets uploaded to TheStraightChoice?.org in the past couple of weeks.<br>
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>

Hi %(name)s,<br>
<br><br>
A massive thanks to the volunteers who organised and attended over 18 local meetings across the country last week. We gathered many more local issues and made lots of new friends. Now it's time for a new Democracy Club task!<br>
