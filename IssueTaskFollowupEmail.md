{{{Dear %(name)s,

A massive thanks to everyone who uploaded leaflets to TheStraightChoice  (http://www.thestraightchoice.org/). Keep uploading them as they arrive! What we want to do now is to continue building our database of local issues to ask candidates about, pushing from 64% of constituencies to 100%.

Click on the "start this task" link below to start contributing local issue!

Something is better than nothing, if you don't know any local issues off the top of your head then do a bit of research online (local newspaper websites, candidate websites, leaflets on TheStraightChoice). If you need inspiration, take a look at some of the issues collected in Cambridge (http://bit.ly/am5fQr).

Thanks,

Seb, Tim, Francis, Tom and the Democracy Club team

P.S. We've lots of new tasks for you in store over the next couple of weeks. We'll be asking you to help us get volunteers in 100 percent of constituencies (we're at 98 percent right now); help track down candidate contact details; and turn local issues into questions.}}}
