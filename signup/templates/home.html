<em><a href="/aboutus/">Democracy Club</a></em> is a new, independent network of volunteers who want to help internet-savvy transparency groups like <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> and <a href="http://www.thestraightchoice.org/">The Straight Choice</a> to hold election candidates and representatives to account. Both of these organisations endorse this project. If you sign up, we will (in time) suggest ways you might want to help them.

<p>
When you sign up, representatives of these organisations will occasionally suggest tasks by email, <a href="/aboutus/#what">such as</a> gathering information on general election candidates or finding and sharing election leaflets, to help them build awesome sites that will make the next election the most transparent ever. They'll also help you to collaborate with other volunteers in your area.
</p>
<!--<p>
We already know that mySociety wants to gather information on general election candidates, and TheStraightChoice wants you to help them find and share election leaflets. As the election approaches there'll be even more things to do, and you can be part of it.
</p>-->

<p class="small">We will occasionally suggest tasks on behalf of other transparency related groups, but we'll never share your private details with anyone, and we'll never send you more than two emails a week, no matter what.  Read our <a href="/aboutus/#privacy">terms and conditions</a> for more.</p>
