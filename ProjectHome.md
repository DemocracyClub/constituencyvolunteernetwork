Democracy Club (n√©e constituency volunteer network) is a website designed to help democracy activists volunteer to do tasks in their local constituency.

The software is written in Django/Python. There's a GettingStarted guide for developers.  You might find some of us on IRC: `#democracyclub` on http://freenode.net/freenode.

**We are now hosted on Github: https://github.com/democracyclub.**
