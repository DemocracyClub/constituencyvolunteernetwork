# Introduction #

Brainstorming how the local issues gathering stuff should work.

## Emails from Seb's volunteers ##

I emailed 5 people asking for help coming up with examples of local issues.  I mentioned the [North Kelvin Meadow](http://northkelvinmeadow.com) as an example. Three got back to me.  Here's what they said:

### Norman ###
I fear I'm not about to be very helpful here.  The only times I've felt exercised enough about something to contact my MP, the issue has been national rather than local.  Though I've been sitting here thinking, I can't come up with any specifically local issues (I do at least feel rather embarassed about this).

About the only thing I can come up with is the poor provision or support for cycling within Glasgow as a whole.  That's partly a story about cycle paths, but paths are only a conveniently-headlineable component of the solution, which also concerns the local authority (in traffic and road planning), the police (not to see cyclists as road vermin), cyclists themselves (lights!), and motorist education and expectations.

The North Kelvin Meadow (which I hadn't heard about before) sounds like a Good Thing.  Unfortunately, new affordable (if it is) high-density housing (as opposed to suburban/scheme sprawl) sounds like a Good Thing, too, so there's a shortage of crystal clarity there!

### Steven ###
Something I feel we might need to prepared to test (and prepare)
candidates for is a flurry of industrial action between now and the next
general election. In particular the capping of public sector pay rises
to 1% announced in the recent pre-Budget report:

And the unofficial "work-to-rule" action by G.C.C refuse collections
might also escalate:

the major issue in my mind is safe and pleasant transport, prioritising cycling and walking, which is the win, win, win policy - improving the health of the local population through exercise and better air quality, reducing stress caused by traffic clogging roads, and helping to reduce co2 emissions. i would say that the major reason people do not cycle more is for fear of getting run over. the cycle lanes that have been provided so far are nothing more than glorified parking lots, clearly implemented to pay lip service to an idea, rather than actually answering a need.

the north kelvin meadow is also one of the issues i would have raised, honest, cos we were just walking there the other day, and i thought it would make for lovely allotments with a bit of green space. the other thing that would have occured to me would be general support for the friends of the river kelvin, and making the kelvin a real asset for local people for relaxation and transport with bicycles and pedestrians able to get about without having to choke/get run over on gt western road. after some work it could even become a real attraction for visitors, joining up the botanic gardens, kelvingrove park, the museum...etc etc.

i looked up some websites, but it didn't really help - wikipedia was the most helpful.

## Feedback from people Francis spoke with ##

### Southport ###

1. Should the children's A&E ward that was recently closed be
reopened?

2. During temporary closure of the central library for rebuilding,
should library services be provided in the covered market or
distributed to branch libraries?

3. There was one about the local MP's expenses but it's quite hard to
ask those concretely / fairly. Probably better done with national
questions on the subject.

4. Does it matter if a candidate is from the constituency? Again a
national question really, but informed by local issues.


### Lancaster ###

1. Should the bypass be built, or should a bridge be built in the
city centre instead?

2. Should part of the city centre be knocked down and redeveloped?


### Liverpool ###

1. Should the houses in Edge Hill be demolished and redeveloped? (it
is now in progress, so perhaps is actually an issue from the last
election).

2. Should the council cancel / retender its BT outsourcing contract
for telephone / call centre services?

3. Should there be a shared stadium for Everton and Liverpool? (again,
things have moved on since this, but there is likely a related
controversial question about proposals for the new stadiums)

## Emails to Tim ##

I emailed the people in the Cambridge constituency.

Broadly, I'm skeptical about dividing candidates as much as dividing the policies that they stand for, as they'll be subject to the party whip.  There may be circumstances where we may be able to find evidence of them arguing for or against a particular issue (e.g. David Howarth swinging the debate about nuclear power at LD conf in Sept this year).  Naturally for existing MPs seeking reelection, we'll be able to see their voting record.

So. Local issues.  What did David Howarth have to do with Cambridge NW?  Supporters could argue that he may have helped secure new environmental standards, as he did raise it in parliament, and that may have influenced government policy...

However, it would be more accurate to say that it was generally down to the councils involved, officers and the executive councillors / cabinet members.  If Sian Reid is selected as the LD candidate (she's on the shortlist) then that it could be relevant.


Therefore, I think it's more relevant for us to be grilling them on broader national issues which affect us locally.

e.g. Will they support the re-localisation of business rates, and a conversion to site value rating?
Do they support greater control of local transport services?
What's their view on supermarkets?  Do they believe locals should be able to prevent a given store from opening in a given area (e.g. Mill Rd Tesco)?

These are all local issues which are controlled by national policy.  They're the sort of thing that I think you're looking for.

A lot of key local issues in Cambridge revolve around proposed new development in and around the city.

There was Parliamentary hustings focused on growth recently at which a number specific issues were raised:

1.  Is Cambridge getting enough infrastructure investment to help it cope with new development in and around the city. How ought national funds for infrastructure be distributed. How should development be taxed?

2.  You mentioned the North West Cambridge Site, others might be particularly interested in the Airport Site, the Southern Fringe or the NIAB site. There are common questions which apply to all the sites:
> i/ How much development can the city sustain?
> i/ How much green space ought be in the developments?
> iii/ To what quality standards ought extensions to the city be build, in terms of architecture, transport, energy efficiency etc. ?
> iv/ Can we just build homes, or do we need other facilities too.?

If you start looking at a specific site, such as the airport, you could ask - should we encourage ARU to move lots of facilities out there?  If we got a new cultural venue would that make the development acceptable? How strongly should we push Marshall off the site? How do we deal with transport issues?

In North / West Cambridge one of the key specific questions is if we should be dividing the city further and allowing the creation of a "university quarter" in which those working for the university can are concentrated. Is such a development a reasonable way of providing affordable housing for those working in the university?

3. The A14; This is a politically contentious subject; with the Lib Dems wanting only to tweak a couple of junctions; others want to see a new road built near Huntington and widening the road near Cambridge. There is the connected matter of a link road to the new town of Northstowe, which is proposed to run parallel  to the A14 for a short stretch, which the Lib Dems are opposing.   The A14 problems are linked to other matters such as the faction of freight which goes by road vs rail, the amount of goods which are imported, and where our container ports are located.

5. Regional government - this is a key matter for Cambridge as many decisions on Policing, Health, Development, Transport etc. are made by relatively undemocratic regional bodies. Do we have regional planning right, are organisations like "Cambridgeshire Horizons" and "Cambridgeshire Horizons" working?    Should Cambridge have a unitary authority?

6. House prices / availability of affordable housing. Will new building help increase supply?

All the above are quite closely interlinked. One question is - how specific do you want these topics to be.

Further matters raised at the Conservative Caucus to select the Conservative candidate included:

6. "Antisocial behavior"

7. Cycle theft

8. Cycle parking at the station.

9. Availability of school places / investment in schools.

http://www.rtaylor.co.uk/nick-hillman-conservative-ppc-cambridge.html

National issues with particular resonance to Cambridge:

1. IDCards / National ID Database.
2. Tuition fees  - should the cap on fees be removed.
3. Should we build new nuclear power stations.
4. Do we need to keep a nuclear deterrent.
5. How should we ensure our future energy security.

The latter three being perhaps more important in Cambridge as we've got a prominent green candidate standing.

With the Green and Lib Dems both proposing changes to the electoral system it might be worth a question asking if people value a constituency MP or would be happy with proportional representation and a list system.

Sorry for the delay. I hope this is the sort of thing that you were after!

Should the council have developed the guided bus-way or, with hindsight, would the less dramatic suggestions (road way / rail way) have been more sensible?
(Any google link to the Guided Busway should do for reference)

Does having one party controlling the city and a different party controlling the shire help or hinder local politics?
( http://www.rtaylor.co.uk/mud-lane-streetlight.html )

Should the council and council's meetings be open and transparent consistently, or only when it suits them?
( http://www.rtaylor.co.uk/jesus-green-playground-desolate.html
and http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/jesus_green_working_group_2009 )

I could go on, but I'm in danger of not remaining 'on topic'
