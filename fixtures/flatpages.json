[{"pk": 1, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "About us", "url": "/aboutus/", "template_name": "", "sites": [1], "content": "<p class=\"loud\">We are building a network of election volunteers to help mySociety and TheStraightChoice in the run up to the next general election, and hopefully beyond. We want your help\r\nto achieve this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In elections these days, all major candidates have a huge team of\r\nvolunteers behind them, helping them produce and distribute leaflets,\r\nget publicity in the local news media, raising their profile and\r\npainting a generally rosy picture of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the public gets no such help. They are given election leaflets,\r\nparty election broadcasts, newspaper interviews with candidates, but\r\nthey are not given solid, factual information, or simple unbiased\r\nanalysis of the truth value of these publicity campaigns, especially not at a local level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We feel that the public needs its own team of volunteers to help them.\r\nWe want you to be one of those volunteers: gather information on\r\ncandidates, their leaflets, and local news coverage of them; or\r\npublicise vote analyses in local papers around the country; or do other\r\ntasks we haven't even thought of yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With your help, we can give the public the same support that the\r\ncandidates already get.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"why\"></a><h3>What's the background to this site?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our friends at <a href=\"http://www.mysociety.org/\">mySociety</a>, which runs some of the best-known democracy and transparency websites in the UK, often get approached by people who would like to volunteer to help with websites like\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/\">TheyWorkForYou.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fixmystreet.com/\">FixMyStreet.com</a>. This site was conceived as a way for someone to contribute to transparency and accountability projects like these without having\r\nto learn how to be a computer programmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"what\"></a><h3>What is the site actually for?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We're asking people to sign up to be constituency volunteers.  Initially they will be asked to carry out volunteer tasks for both our friends at mySociety, and our friends who run the wonderful election leaflet website <a href=\"http://www.thestraightchoice.org/\">TheStraightChoice.org</a>. What this\r\nmeans is putting yourself forward to help with tasks such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Helping to establish who is standing for election at the next\r\ngeneral election in your constituency, so that we can tell the public\r\nabout them, share that information with other websites, and gather\r\ninformation on their political views</li>\r\n<li>Which local campaigns and issues need putting to candidates in order\r\nto have a clear record of candidates views on the issues that matter\r\nto local people</li>\r\n<li>What election materials are being sent around, containing what\r\npromises and what accusations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We promise we won't hammer you with requests &mdash; you'll never get more than two emails a week &mdash; in fact the sum total of\r\nvolunteering between now and the general election could easily be less\r\nthan a dozen hours. But it's all super important, because only real\r\npeople like you know what issues are critical in every corner of the\r\ncountry. Together we can do a better job than any of the newspapers, and without the political spin too.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"who\"></a><h3>And who are you, then?</h3>\r\n<p>We are a small group of volunteers (at the time of writing, Seb Bacon, Tim Green and Tom Dunham) who have set up this website initially to support mySociety and TheStraightChoice.org.  If you're a programmer and would like to help us build the rest of the website, check out our <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/constituencyvolunteernetwork/\">Google Code page</a> and join <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/cvn-developers\">our mailing list</a>.  If you're someone with a website that campaigns on subjects related to democracy and would like to use Democracy Club to crowdsource finding local information, drop us a <a href=\"mailto:seb.bacon@gmail.com\">private email</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why isn't mySociety or TheStraightChoice running this site themselves?</h3>\r\n<p>mySociety and TheStraightChoice are different organisations, constrained by different rules and laws (mySociety is run out of a registered charity for example), and run by different people. In order to prevent a situation where our two organisations could disagree about what we were asking, we asked Seb Bacon to set up this independent site. Seb owns the data, and runs the site, we just get to send messages through it, messages that will come from either mySociety, or TheStraightChoice. Bureaucratic deadlocks are therefore avoided in advance, duplicate volunteer networks avoided, and friendships preserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can I sign up as a volunteer to cover more than one constituency?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes, we know that people often have quite detailed knowledge of\r\nseveral constituencies, so we're enabling people to sign up to\r\nvolunteer for three constituencies each. However, the constituency for\r\nwhich you enter your postcode will be considered your primary patch.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"how\"></a><h3>How is my volunteering going to help you make better websites at the election?</h3>\r\n<p>We know from the success of TheyWorkForYou that people like clear,\r\nno-nonsense, politically neutral information on their politicians -\r\nwhat they said, how they voted, whether they ever showed up, and so\r\non.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This information is never more valuable than in the run up to a\r\ngeneral election, but it is really hard to find out who's running in\r\nan election. And even when you have found out, their views are often\r\nrecorded in a thousand different places, not nicely findable when you\r\nneed them, via Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We plan to ask all candidates at the next general election certain\r\nquestions about a wide range of policy issues, some written by\r\nmySociety, some written by national campaign groups, and many written\r\njust for certain local candidates by local people and local\r\norganisations. We can build the software which will send these\r\nquestions, and which will record and share the responses given by\r\ncandidates on our own. However,\r\nwhat we can't do is find out everyone who is standing across the UK,\r\nand we can't possibly find out what local-specific questions need\r\nasking to get a rounded view of all candidates. This is where you come\r\nin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can I share the job with other local people?</h3>\r\n<p>We very much hope that multiple volunteers will sign up in the same\r\nconstituencies. In these cases we will use email to put volunteers in\r\ntouch with each other to make up their own minds how to divvy up\r\ntasks, identify local issues, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"privacy\"></a><h3>What are the terms and conditions relating to my personal data on this site?</h3>\r\n<p>By signing up you consent to receive a maximum of two messages per week in total from Democracy Club. Your personal data will be controlled by Seb Bacon, and it will not be shared with any other third party without your consent.  Your data will be used only for purposes relating to helping democracy-related organisations like mySociety and The Straight Choice to carry out candidate, politician and election based volunteering tasks. Your data will never be sold or used for commercial purposes, and it will not be disclosed to anyone else unless you choose the option to share your address with fellow constituents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do choose this option then anyone who signs up with a postcode somewhere within your constituency will be able to see your name and email address, but not postcode. The purpose of this is so that volunteers have an easy and low-tech way of talking together about how to divide up volunteering tasks. Note - we cannot verify that someone is a fellow constituent other than by them putting in a postcode, so if someone puts in a fake postcode and then discovers your email address, they may be able to use it for abusive purposes. Seb Bacon and other volunteers disclaim any responsibility for what happens if you choose to share your email like this, as it is, for a moderately clever programmer, essentially public information. In short, don't tick the share option if it is extremely important to you that your name and email address remain private. We, mySociety and TheStraightChoice also disclaim anything bad that happens to you whilst you're engaged in the volunteer tasks which get sent out. Picking up leaflets is dangerous, and we won't pay for your bad back or paper cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "Contact", "url": "/contact/", "template_name": "", "sites": [1], "content": "<p>If you have a general question, or an idea about how you think the site should work, you can get in touch with the developer team at <a href=\"mailto:developers@democracyclub.org.uk\">developers@democracyclub.org.uk</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you've found a bug and you'd like to report it, please use our <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/constituencyvolunteernetwork/issues/entry?template=Defect%20report%20from%20user\">issue tracker</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're a developer and you'd like to help out, say hi on our <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/cvn-developers\">project mailing list</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For media enquiries or similar, get in touch with Seb Bacon at <a href=\"mailto:seb@democracyclub.org.uk\">seb@democracyclub.org.uk</a>.</p>", "enable_comments": false}}]
