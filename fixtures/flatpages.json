[{"pk": 1, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "About Us", "url": "/about/", "template_name": "", "sites": [1], "content": "<h3>What's the background to this site?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mysociety.org/\">mySociety</a> is often approached by people who would like to volunteer\r\nto help with our transparency and democracy websites like\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com\">TheyWorkForYou.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fixmystreet.com/\">FixMyStreet.com</a>. This site is a great chance to\r\nget involved as an active community member of mySociety without having\r\nto learn how to be a computer programmer.\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the site actually for?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We're asking people to sign up to be constiuency volunteers for\r\nmySociety and our friends who run <a href=\"http://www.thestraightchoice.org/\">TheStraightChoice.org</a>. What this\r\nmeans is putting yourself forward to help with tasks such as:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Helping to establish who is standing for election at the next\r\ngeneral election in your constituency, so that we can tell the public\r\nabout them, share that information with other websites, and gather\r\ninformation on their political views.\r\n<li>Which local campaigns and issues need putting to candidates in order\r\nto have a clear record of candidates views on the issues that matter\r\nto local people\r\n<li>What election materials are being sent around, containing what\r\npromises and what accucations.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We promise we won't hammer you with requests, in fact the sum total of\r\nvolunteering between now and the general election could easily be less\r\nthan a dozen hours. But it all matters because the only people who know what's important in every corner of the country are people like you.\r\n\r\n<h3>Can I sign up as a volunteer to cover more than one constituency?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, we know that people often have quite detailed knowledge of\r\nseveral constituencies, so we're enabling people to sign up to\r\nvolunteer for three constituencies each. However, the constituency for\r\nwhich you enter your postcode will be considered your primary patch.\r\n\r\n<h3>How is my volunteering going to help you make better websites at the election?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We know from the success of TheyWorkForYou that people like clear,\r\nno-nonsense, politically neutral information on their politicians -\r\nwhat they said, how they voted, whether they ever showed up, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\n<p>This information is never more valuable than in the run up to a\r\ngeneral election, but it is really hard to find out who's running in\r\nan election. And even when you have found out, their views are often\r\nrecorded in a thousand different places, not nicely findable when you\r\nneed them, via Google.\r\n\r\n<p>We plan to ask all candidates at the next general election certain\r\nquestions about a wide range of policy issues, some written by\r\nmySociety, some written by national campaign groups, and many written\r\njust for certain local candidates by local people and local\r\norganisations. We can build the software which will send these\r\nquestions, and which will record and share the responses given by\r\ncandidates on our own, just the little mySociety core team. However\r\nwhat we can't do is find out everyone who is standing across the UK,\r\nand we can't possibly find out what local-specific questions need\r\nasking to get a rounded view of all candidates. This is where you come\r\nin.\r\n\r\n<h3>Can I share the job with other local people?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We very much hope that many volunteers will sign up in the same\r\nconstituencies. In these cases we will use email to put volunteers in\r\ntouch with each other to make up their own minds how to divvy up\r\ntasks, identify local issues, and so on.", "enable_comments": false}}]
