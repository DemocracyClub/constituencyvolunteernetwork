Subject: Update from Democracy Club

Hi %(d)s,

The election's finally been called, so we thought it was time for a quick round up.  Here's what Democracy Club volunteers have managed to achieve in the last few months:

You've written nearly 3000 local issues, covering three quarters of the country, about pot holes, hospital closures, green spaces and supermarkets.  We're in the process of turning some of these into questions that we're going to ask your candidates.  Issues that aren't used as questions will remain in our database and provide a useful picture of what people care about across the country, so keep them coming!

You've uploaded photos of nearly 200 election leaflets.  There are many more in the database you're helping to build at http://www.thestraightchoice.org/.  Please keep adding more as they arrive and help hold parties to account for what they're saying at the doorstep.

You're helping build the UK's first, comprehensive, free database of candidates, and just by playing our curiously addictive game, you've discovered more than 2000 previously unknown contact details for candidates who want your vote on May 6th.  Whenever you hear about new candidates, upload them to http://www.yournextmp.com/ -- we now know about most of the main parties, but we're yet to hear about many independents.

Finally, you've helped recruit volunteers in all but 5 UK constituencies.  Today, we're asking you to help us by inviting 3 or more friends to join as volunteers.  If you know people anyone near Llaneli, Mid Ulster, or Rutherglen, make sure you invite them!  If you don't, just invite three people who would enjoy helping make our democracy more transparent.

Thanks,

Seb, Tim, Tom and everyone else at Democracy Club
