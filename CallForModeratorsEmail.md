As we get close to the general election, we're moving closer to our next project: building a questionnaire about local and national issues.

With your help, we've already collected lots of information about important local issues.  Now we want to use these as a basis for writing direct questions that we can put to candidates.  To do this, we need a number of people with copywriting experience to go through the local issues and use them to compose questions.  If you have good prose writing skills and experience, please email us at copywriters@democracyclub.org.uk.

When the questionnaire is finished, we'll try to send it to every candidate in every constituency.  This will help you get a better idea about the people who want your vote, and hold them accountable after the election

As we get close to the election we're now moving to the next stage of our
local issue gathering. We want to start turning the local issues people have
submitted on Democracy Club into good quality questions for a questionnaire
that we'll be sending to candidates. This questionnaire is designed to find
out candidate's stances before the election and hold them accountable after.
To do this, we need a number of people with copywriting experience to go
through checking issues and perhaps improving them. If you're interested,
just email us at developers@democracyclub.org.uk.

Keep adding issues, though! We still have some way to go in getting them in
all constituencies.

Thanks,
Tim
