# Motivation #

Currently if someone posts a message in a constituency the only way a volunteer in that constituency can find out about it is if they either check the constituency page or log in and look at their activity feed.

# Solution #

We want to add email notifications to tell volunteers when a message is posted in their constituency. Things we need to deal with

  * Consent to email

  * Form of the email

## Consent to email ##

The proposal is to have a notification option for each user in each constituency. If this exists, when a message is posted in the constituency an email alert is triggered.

We do, however, have to initially set up this consent with minimal spam. I propose that if consent doesn't exist for a user in a constituency, we email them once to tell them that a message has been posted (without the message text) and advise them that they can turn notifications on on the constituency page, and then turn off all future notifications unless manually enabled.

## Form of the email ##

Questions

  * Should the email contain the text of the message? Might be considered open to abuse if it does, though most sites now do.

  * Should the option be given to receive a weekly digest of messages instead of an email for every message? Adds more complexity, and it depends how many messages we have.
