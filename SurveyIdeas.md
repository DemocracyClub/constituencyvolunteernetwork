Very quick brainstorm!  Needs work!

We should probably do three surveys.  One to candidates, one to DC volunteers, and one to quiz users.  We can send the same survey to the latter two.  The one for candidates can be largely similar, too, I think.

# Possible questions #

## About them ##

  * How interested are you in politics
  * Have you voted before
  * Age range
  * Gender
  * Ethnicity
  * Post code
  * Did you receive any leaflets in the run up to the election
  * Did you receive visits from canvassers
  * How did you find out about the survey
  * How did you vote
  * How did you vote last time

## Impact ##

  * Did it help you find out who your candidates were / did you have any other way of  knowing
  * Did you see / were you aware of YNMP
  * Did the survey influence your decision about who to vote for
  * If so, why/how
  * If not, why/now
  * Did it stimulate your interest in the election


## Learning lessons ##
  * Did you find it easy to use
  * Did you notice where candidate had failed to answer?
  * Some candidates objected to some of the questions as they were complex issues.  What do you feel about this
  * Some candidates objected to responding to surveys in general, some because they get asked so many, others because they failed to capture "nuances".  Do you understand their point of view?
  * We believe that knowing about the personal views of your MP is at least as important as those of their party -- do you agree
  * Number of questions / balance of questions good?
  * Was it useful to have local and national issues?
  * Did the agree/disagree format work for you?
  * Candidates have often wanted more space -- do you agree
  * Did you tell your friends about it?
  * What would you do differently next time, if you were us?
  * Any ideas for what we should do next?
