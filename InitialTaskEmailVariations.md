# Outcome #

From a test of 400 mailouts, it was found that the short text combined with the subjects

  * "We need your help to find out what's going on in your constituency"
  * "What's going on near you?"

Worked best in terms of opening and completion rates (first one being the best).

## Reworked text 2 ##

A version of the text for the first follow-up / reminder email:

> Dear s(name)%,

> The response to our last email was incredible. As a result of your collective efforts, we now know that:
    * Some people in Ashford want the Eurostar to stop there more often
    * The funding of the air ambulance is an issue in Dwyfor Meirionnydd
    * There's a feeling in South Derbyshire that there aren't enough allotments

> ... plus nearly 700 other issues, with at least one in a third of all UK constituencies.

> Our next target is ambitious - we want 2000 local political statements, covering at least  half the country, by the end of the week. We will use these 2000 statements to pin candidates down, so we all get to find out which side of key local issues they lie on.

> Can you help us reach 2000 local statements? Or do you know someone who could? if we get this right, perhaps the next bunch of MPs won't have to be charged by the police...

Hello,

Thanks for signing up as a democracy activist with Democracy Club - it means a lot.

The first thing we need your help with is researching local issues around your constituency. Later, we'll use these to build a questionnaire which we'll send to your local candidates.

This might be slightly trickier said than done (if you think so, then please drop us a line!).  We'll soon be suggesting you meet other local volunteers to work on it together, but you don't have to meet right away to make a start.

The links below give you a choice of what to do now.  If you don't want to do this, it's best to press the "ignore" button, so we don't ask you again. Otherwise, please dig in - it's going to be quite a journey together!

Thank you,

Seb, Tim, Francis, Tom and the DemocracyClub team

Hello there!

Thank you so much for signing up to DemocracyClub , the unprecedented volunteer driven project to help gather non-partisan information on all the candidates standing at this year's general election. There are now more than 2000 of you across the UK - a veritable army ready to help make this the most accountable election ever. If you want a reminder of what the project is all about, read this: http://bit.ly/wYYz3

If you are getting this email then you're one of the first 100 people to be sent our first task: we'll be sending this email to the other 2000 volunteers across the UK once we've heard back from the initial testers.

The very first thing we need you to do is this:

We need you to research which local issues candidates standing in your constituency differ on

Even with so many of your volunteering across the country, it's going to be a lot of work to gather so much information on key local issues. But the benefit is going to be unprecedented in terms of helping Britons understand what their candidates stand for. And you're going to be part of it - we need you all to help.

**Help For You In Doing This Task**

1. Use Google to see if any of your candidates have websites. If they do, read them to find if they make clear statements on local issues. If they don't have their own sites, check local newspaper sites or facebook to see if you can find anything. You could also check http://openlylocal.com/hyperlocal_sites for any nearby blogs. If you can't find any issues, why not drop some of your candidates a friendly email asking them to say what the most important changes they think need making in the constituency? 2. You can ask questions and share experiences on the discussion forum here http://bit.ly/8tEumz

3. You can hold Democracy Club Local Meetings in a pub or cafe of your choice. Bring paper, pens, local newspapers, and be prepared to meet some friendly people. We need **you** to organise these get togethers, so go to this forum http://bit.ly/6Tznwz - and say you want to meet up.

4. Get your friends to join DemocracyClub, and share the workload with them.

5. Reply to this email and we'll do what we can

Even if you can't start right now, please let us know what you think of the challenge, and how else we can support you.

all the best,

Tom, Seb, Tim, Francis and the Democracy Club crew
