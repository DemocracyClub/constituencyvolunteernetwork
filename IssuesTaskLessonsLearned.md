# Introduction #

In Jan and Feb we sent out three variations of email text and lots and lots of variations of subject lines, to test their relative success at converting supporters into task-completers.

These are some subjective conclusions of the experiment based on statistics and user feedback.

# Email subject #
In order of success in getting the emails opened:

  * Over 600 ideas submitted - help us hit 2000 (42%)
  * Make a statement (43%)
  * Make a statement in %(constituency)s (45%)
  * What's going on in %(constituency)s? (59%)
  * We need your help to find out what's going on in your constituency (63%)
  * An incredible response - let's hit 2000 ideas (63%)

Patterns are hard to discern here, but tentatively it looks like successful subject lines beg a question in some way ("why was it incredible?", "why do they need my help").

What's particularly interesting is that a high open rate doesn't correlate with a high task completion rate.  Specifically, the two subject lines that produced the lowest open rates also produced the highest completion rates.  "Make s statement" generated 40% more actual Issues than "An incredible response - let's hit 2000 ideas".

The best conclusion must be that we shouldn't worry too much about subject lines, as we are unlikely to understand the interaction between them and task completion.  We can continue to monitor statistics in case particularly bad or good examples appear.

# Email body #
In the one experiment we've done so far on this, it seems pretty clear that a short email produces more clickthroughs and completions than a long email.

We received a couple of bits of user feedback that apparently relate to the email text:

  * "what is a 'local political statements' (per email received today)"
  * I don't understand exactly what is meant by "political statement" and I can't see anything about this task on the web site itself... all I can see is that I've started the 'describe local issues in Lichfield' task.
  * Can I ask what you mean my local statements?  Would that include lifting quotes from flyers that are beginning to come through my door?  Or actually calling/ emailing candidates for statements?  Statements on what?

It seems that the phrase "political statements" needs altering.  It's not an everyday phrase that has an immediately obvious meaning.

One more obvious error here is that we used inconsistent terminology: both "issues" and "statements".

  * "I can't get the links to work on this one - it is taking me back to the "local issues" task.  Will be happy to gather some local political statements when I can read the actual task."
  * the attached email I got below is a bit confusing - it refers to the "next target" which made me think that this was a new task, when, as I understand it, it's asking for me to add more issues as before.  "Start this task" also suggests it's something that I haven't already been doing

These people were confused by the fact we had sent the same task twice, but called it different things each time.

It would perhaps help to mention previous (and future) emails to give a sense of narrative.

  * "In order for me to be able to provide a satisfactory response to your request, I am wondering whether you could provide some standard wording and/or template wording for me to send to my MP in order to get the answers that you need."

This is presumably simply a case of not reading the email.  Probably including the text "to get started please select one of the following links" in bold would help.

Most of the feedback we got related to usability of the issues gathering form:

  * "I keep stalling at the the bit about needing a URL web site as evidence of an issue. What is it you need please "

We could explain a bit more **why** we're asking for this bit of information, inline.

  * On the task page, when I press Save does this mean I am sending the comment as I cannot see a `send` box?

Another case of giving people the bigger picture.  If we could succinctly explain the next filtering phase, it would give context.  Perhaps we've over-simplified the task page by stripping out any information.

  * Someone called Peter has apparently completed this task Lichfield yet I can't see any results of his carrying out this task. Also, it makes sense for myself and Peter to work together but there is no way for me to contact him and propose collaborating
  * There is a problem with your website:it's not userfriendly for non-geeks like me.  First of all there is no obvious link to the list of constituencies. I stagger from weblink to weblink and still cannot remember how I got to a forum.  Today I did find my constituency after some staggering I clicked on adding issues to Stockport only be be sent back to your home page.  However, I have been unable to find a login.  If I do enter my details in the box I have been sent to I am told I am already registered. This is demotivating.

Both important usability issues.  We should consider ways of tidying up the task interface: better cross-referencing between people, tasks they've done, etc.  It's clear we should also add a username / password to the system.  It's simply what people expect.
