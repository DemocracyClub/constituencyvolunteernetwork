# Introduction #

It's evident that asking people for closed yes/no or agree/disagree questions is probably not the best way to get good questions. Maybe it'd be better to reformat it as being a question for a controversial statement that the candidates can then agree/disagree with (with reason)

## Current text ##

1. Enter a controversial local question to ask candidates about.

e.g. Should the bypass round Lancaster be built?

Keep it genuinely local to City of Durham constituency. We'll ask candidates national questions anyway, separately. Make sure it divides the candidates.
2. If possible, please provide a link that shows that this is a real local issue

e.g. http://www.cares.ukhome.net/

## Suggested change ##

1. Enter a simple, clear statement on a local issue which you believe some local candidates would agree with, and which others would disagree with.

e.g. "The bypass around Lancaster should be built"

No questions! Just statements. Keep it genuinely local to City of Durham constituency. We'll ask candidates national questions anyway, separately. Make sure it divides the candidates.
